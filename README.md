This is a simple board game recommender. It uses the BoardGameGeek API (https://boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/BGG_XML_API&redirectedfrom=XML_API#).

The script takes a username's current collection and looks for boardgames rated between a min and max rating. Then a list of other users who have gave a similar rating to those boardgames is analyzed and the most frequent ratings for other boardgames are counted. The program outputs a list of other boardgames that the user might want to consider buying.
